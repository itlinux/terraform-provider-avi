= Build Azure Controller
This part is replicating what has been done with AWS. Therefore, we are going to build either a cluster or stand alone controller. This section is reference to the Cluster version, consequently, we will deploy 3 Avi Controllers.

NOTE: There are a few variables to change and make sure you update them to make it work in your env.

== Access Azure
On the remote box I normally run az login to get granted access. You could use your laptop, (demo only), as I would not execute your deployment from the laptop in a production env. Use a Jumpbox etc for production.

.Make sure you do have the following to build your infrastructure. 
----
subscription_id = ""
client_id       = ""
client_secret   = ""
tenant_id       = ""
----

== Infrastructure 
We deploy 1 controller per AZ.
