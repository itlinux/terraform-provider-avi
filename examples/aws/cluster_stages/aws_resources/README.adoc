== Avi Controller

* You will need to make sure to have an IAM role with the options to deploy Avi Controller.

The full schema can be checked from:
https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/iam-role-setup-for-installation-into-aws/[Full Role Settings]
Here is a very basic version to allow deployment.

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::avi-se-*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::avi-se-*/*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
                "ec2:CopySnapshot",
                "ec2:RegisterImage",
                "ec2:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

Once that's done, create a file named terraform.tfvars to add your password. An example is included as terraform.tfvars.example.

Update the variables to match what will be available into your AWS.


NOTE: if you are going to delete the Avi Controllers and you have deployed the SE, terraform will not be able to finish the task!
Which means you will have to do a lot of manual deletion and then clean up the terraform to get back into the clean state.
