# AVI Provider

The AVI provider is used to interact with [AVI Controller](https://avinetworks.com/).
The provider needs
to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

# Integrating Terraform with Avi Vantage
Each Avi Vantage REST resource is exposed as a resource in Terraform. For instance, you can setup a pool by using avi_pool as the resource type in Terraform. There are more than 50 different REST resources supported.

Each Terraform resource maps directly to a corresponding Avi Vantage API as defined in the Swagger Spec (available on any Avi Vantage Controller at https://<controller>/swagger/) or the API documentation (available [here](https://avinetworks.com/docs/latest/api-guide/)). There is a 1:1 mapping between the fields in the Terraform schema and the corresponding Avi Vantage object definition.

Avi Terraform provider is a native integration into the Terraform to setup all Avi configuration that is part of Avi REST API. With the Avi Terraform provider, a Terraform plan written in HCL syntax can specify any Avi configuration and it will be reflected on the Avi Controller. For instance, you can use a Terraform plan with the following code to setup a pool in Avi Vantage.

```hcl
resource "avi_pool" "testpool" {
  name= "pool-42"
  health_monitor_refs= [avi_healthmonitor.test_hm_1.id]
  tenant_ref= data.avi_tenant.default_tenant.id
  cloud_ref= data.avi_cloud.default_cloud.id
  servers {
    ip {
      type= "V4"
      addr= "x.x.x.x"
    }
    port= 8080
  }
  fail_action {
    type= "FAIL_ACTION_CLOSE_CONN"
  }
}
```
The above code breaks down as follows::
* The line below declares a resource of type ‘pool’ with name ‘testpool’:

```hcl
  resource "avi_pool" "testpool" {
```
* The line below shows a field that is a reference to another Terraform resource declared elsewhere in the plan:

```hcl 
  health_monitor_refs= [avi_healthmonitor.test_hm_1.id]
```
* The line below shows a field that is a reference to a read-only data source corresponding to an existing Avi object not defined through the Terraform plan:

```hcl
  tenant_ref= data.avi_tenant.default_tenant.id
```

* Read-only data sources can be imported either by name or by UUID. For example, the “System-HTTP” application profile can be imported as a data source by name using the following:

```hcl
data "avi_applicationprofile" "system_http_profile" {
  name= "System-HTTP"
}

// can be referenced as data.avi_applicationprofile.system_http_profile.id
```
* Alternatively, a data source can be imported based on the object’s UUID rather than it’s name, for example:
```hcl
data "avi_applicationprofile" "system_http_profile" {
uuid= "applicationprofile-xxxxxxx"
}
```
# Usage Avi Terraform
The following are the steps to use the provider:
1. Terraform module must declare which providers it requires, so that Terraform can install and use them. Provider requirements are declared in a required_providers block. Starting with Terraform version 0.13+, Avi Terraform provider has been migrated to Terraform registry. In order to use it, you need to add the below block in versions.tf file.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    avi = {
      source  = "vmware/avi"
      version = "21.1.1"
    }
  }
}
```
where,
* source — Source of Terraform provider. Terraform will pull the released Avi Terraform provider from Terraform registry from this namespace.

* version — Avi Terraform provider release version in Terraform registry. If this field is skipped then Terraform will pull the latest release of Avi Terraform provider from Terraform registry.

2. Create Avi provider in Terraform plan. For instance, to restrict template version in 0.1.x, you can use the following CLI:
```hcl
provider "avi" {
  avi_username = "admin"
  avi_tenant = "admin"
  avi_password = "password"
  avi_controller = "x.x.x.x"
  avi_version = "21.1.1"
}  
```
3. Create Avi virtual service and pool example. Here the VS and Pool depends on read only tenant, cloud, applicationprofile, sslkeyandcertificate, sslprofile data sources and another networkprofile, vsvip, health monitor defined as a resource in the Terraform plan.
```hcl
data "avi_tenant" "default_tenant" {
  name= "admin"
 }
data "avi_applicationprofile" "system_http_profile" {
  name= "System-HTTP"
 }

data "avi_cloud" "default_cloud" {
  name= "Defaul-Cloud"
 }

data "avi_sslkeyandcertificate" "system_default_cert" {
    name= "System-Default-Cert"
}

data "avi_sslprofile" "system_standard_sslprofile" {
    name= "System-Standard"
}

  cloud_type                    = "CLOUD_VCENTER"
  services {
    port           = 8443
    enable_ssl     = true
  }
}
 ```

## Authentication

The AVI provider offers following means of providing credentials for
authentication:

- Static credentials
- Environment variable

### Static credentials ###

Static credentials can be provided by adding an `avi_username`, `avi_password`, `avi_controller_ip` and `avi_tenant` in-line in the
AVI provider block:

Usage:

```hcl
// Configure the AVI provider
provider "avi" {
  avi_username = "admin"
  avi_tenant = "admin"
  avi_password = "password"
  avi_controller = "x.x.x.x"
  avi_version = "21.1.1"
} 
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via the `AVI_USERNAME`, `AVI_PASSWORD`, `AVI_CONTROLLER` , `AVI_VERSION` and `AVI_TENANT`
environment variables, representing your AVI username, password, controller, api version and tenant, respectively.

```hcl
provider "avi" {}
```
### Usage:

```sh
$ export AVI_USERNAME = username
$ export AVI_PASSWORD = password
$ export AVI_CONTROLLER = x.x.x.x
$ export AVI_TENANT = foo
$ export AVI_VERSION=21.1.1
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
```

You can export `AVI_SUPPRESS_SENSITIVE_FIELDS_DIFF` environment variable as `AVI_SUPPRESS_SENSITIVE_FIELDS_DIFF=true`
if you want Terraform to suppress the difference for sensitive fields during the plan update. However, if you want to
intentionally update the sensitive fields in the plan update then you need to un-export the environment variable or set
it to false, i.e. export `AVI_SUPPRESS_SENSITIVE_FIELDS_DIFF=false` or unset `AVI_SUPPRESS_SENSITIVE_FIELDS_DIFF`.

### Usage:
```sh
$ export AVI_SUPPRESS_SENSITIVE_FIELDS_DIFF = true
```
