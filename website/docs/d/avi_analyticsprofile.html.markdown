# avi_analyticsprofile

This data source is used to to get avi_analyticsprofile objects.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "avi_analyticsprofile" "foo_analyticsprofile" {
    uuid = "analyticsprofile-f9cf6b3e-a411-436f-95e2-2982ba2b217b"
    name = "foo"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Optional) Search AnalyticsProfile by name.
* `uuid` - (Optional) Search AnalyticsProfile by uuid.

## Attributes Reference
